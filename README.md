# FitnessBubble

NotUniversityHacks 2020

Fitness Bubble is an app to help motivate people to exercise in quarantine. It is based off of Snapchat streaks, where you must complete an activity (in this case, a workout) in order to maintain a streak. Users can join groups and workout daily to make sure the streak survives. If one person in a group does not exercise on a day, the whole group's streak disappears.

This app was built using SwiftUI and Firebase for the backend. Within the UI folder, there are many images of our app's UI.
